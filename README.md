# Complaint Summarizer

A web-based tool to extract and summarize complaints from text or images. The system produces concise, detailed, and context-aware summaries while preserving all critical information.

## Features

- Accepts input as **text** or **image**.
- Extracts text from images using OCR.
- Summarizes complaints, retaining essential details like:
  - Dates
  - Incidents
  - Stolen or damaged items
  - Financial details
  - Legal requests
- Generates concise, legally-relevant summaries.
- Built with **Streamlit** for interactive UI.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd complaint-summarizer
````

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

* Upload a text file or enter the complaint manually.
* Or upload an image containing a complaint.
* Click **Summarize** to get the concise summary.

## Dependencies

* `streamlit` - Web interface
* `pytesseract` - OCR for image text extraction
* `Pillow` - Image handling
* `openai` or any NLP library (if using GPT models for summarization)

## Future Improvements

* Multi-language support

* Integration with legal databases for automated section recommendations


I can also make a **shorter, very clean version** suitable for GitHub that highlights only installation, usage, and features, if you want. Do you want me to do that?
